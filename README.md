# simple-workflow
A simple yet elegant workflow tool to manage order/ticket/related use cases. I am creating this because in market there are expensive tools which do not offer the performance and flexibility required.

## why creating a workflow tool when there are plenty in market ?
Because a lot of big corporations charge hefty money whilst still not delivering the performance desired. Also, there isn't enough flexibility to customize. I want to create a package which would have standard workflow elements out of the box whilst giving users an opportunity to drive entire workflow from one place! (for starters it'll be my own definition language, someday I might make an UI interface for it to make it more acceptable).
